**Secure Serverless Notes Application**

The goal is to use Frontend on S3/Cloudfront, Backend with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, all with robust security controls.

I created this IAM user because of the Principle of Least Privilege. This uses a non-root account for daily tasks, strong password policy, and secure handling of access keys as well.

I also stored this in an encrypted file, so it isn't easily accessible.
